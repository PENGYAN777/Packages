Goal: plot rarefaction shock region, which is bounded by LVS and double sonic locus (DSL)
Step:
1. choose one isentrope (s)
2. choose one point (P,v) along the isentrope, set M1=1
3. compute the Rayleigh line until M2=1
4. compare diff between ht1 and ht2, if diff is small, then that is the DS point along the isentrope; otherwise, go back to step 2 and choose another point.
5  choose another isentrope and obtain the DS point
6. collect all DS points and plot DSL
